====== The SLCAN mode ======

The SLCAN mode is for use with the socketcan interface available on Linux. SLCAN is a CAN driver for several 'low cost' CAN interfaces that are attached via serial lines or via USB-to-serial adapters using the LAWICEL ASCII protocol You can use the standard socketcan tools in this mode.

:!: The Frankfurt RS-232 just implements a limited command set of SLCAN, just the commands needed to make the Frankfurt RS-232 usable with socketcan for VSCP. Please contact [[http://www.lawicel.com/|Lawicel AB]] to buy a unit that confirms to the full set of commands if you have that need.
