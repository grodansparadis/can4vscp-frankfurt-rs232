This release does not change the bootloader protocol.
The host PC software should be fully backwards 
compatible with v1.03 and v1.04 bootloader 
firmware.

- Device Database files updated with all 
  latest processor support. 

  PIC18F87K22/K90 family should erase correctly 
  now.

- New PIC12F617 software bit-bang UART bootloader.

- Improved PIC16 enhanced core support. 
  Added more enhanced core options (bootconfig.inc).
  Added LWLO bit support (improves write time).

- Improved PIC16 bootloader firmware portability.

  PIC16F1824, PIC16F1828 ANx analog inputs 
  configured.

  PIC12F1822 enhanced core supported. 

- Improved PIC18 bootloader firmware portability.
  PIC18F14K50 should be easier to set up now.

- PIC18 software boot protect option improved. 
  Should work on 96KB flash memory devices now.

- Improved PIC18 to ease configuration for 
  UART2 operation in bootconfig.inc.

  Improved portability to devices where analog
  input (ANx) is multiplexed with RX input pin.

- PIC18 support for Peripheral Pin Select (PPS).

  Allows use of PPS UART2 on PIC18F46J11/J50 and
  PIC18F47J13/J53 family devices.

- PC software improved to reduce throughput 
  bottlenecks.

- New command-line only host PC software (AN1310cl).

- Fixed bug where host PC software could crash if
  write plan turned out to be empty.

- AN1310ui now allows recording incoming UART 
  data after releasing serial terminal mode.

- GUI should be more responsive during bootload
  operations (bootloader operations run through
  a separate thread now).

- Incremental bootloading bug fixed for large, 
  slowly written HEX files that would sometimes
  trigger an incremental bootload operation
  before the entire HEX file is written.
