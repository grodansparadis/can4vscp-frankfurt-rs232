=== Can the Frankfurt RS-232 module be used as a general CAN-interface adapter? ===

The Frankfurt RS-232 is built to be a low cost alternative to connect CAN4VSCP equipment to a PC or other high end device. Therefore it can only handle 125kbps as bus speed on the CAN-bus (CAN4VSCP). If you look for a good general CAN adapter we recommend the [[http://www.frogshop.se/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=56|USB2CAN]] or the [[http://canusb.com/|CANUSB]].

=== Does the Frankfurt RS-232 module have galvanic isolation to the CAN bus ? ===

No. The upcoming module Frankfurt USB will have this protection and if there is a demand for an isolated RS-232 version we will provide one.
